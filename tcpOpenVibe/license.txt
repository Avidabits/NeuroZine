---------------------------------------------------------
This Pd External is intented to receive data from OpenVibe TCPWrite
taking into account the specification described at:
http://openvibe.inria.fr//documentation/2.0.1/Doc_BoxAlgorithm_TCPWriter.html

In order to use the POSIX sockets of tcpclient I use the library: 
PTHREADS-WIN32 RELEASE 2.9.0 (2012-05-25)
